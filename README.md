### 3rd Commit

- Generate a new route and plot, that shows the monthly average "Open" price in a black line.

- Plotted monthly "High" & "Low" averages in green and red, respectively.

### 4th Commit

- Create a route that lets me choose a drop down from the "/" route, to see a visualization of the specific data and days for the months of January to December.

- Made sure the internal monthly charts display the Open, High, Low prices in black, green, red ; for continuous visualization.

### 5th Commit

- Created a route that allows the user to compare the 2016 monthly averages in a bar chart form.

### Final Notes

- Limited data. Need to choose a stock with more historical data next week for further statistical analysis. Looking at one arbitrary year does not help with investment decisions.
